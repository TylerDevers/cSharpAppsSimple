ASP.NET Core - Beginner from mva.microsoft.com

* build and run an app with $ dotnet run  - from the project directory.
* when creating apps from the console use the '$ dotnet new' keyword. such as:
	*$ dotnet new console
	*$ dotnet new -o web
		// when we run the web app, it will start a local host/ web server

Build Web App
	*dotnet new -o web // will create the project.
	in Startup.cs - configureServices by 
		services.AddMvc();
    
	now use the service in Configure()
		app.UseMvc();
		//using mvc will bypass the app.run in configure. It will now look for Index.cshtml, if it does not find index, it will default to whatever is within app.Run.
		
	add a pages folder to the project, nest a Index.cshtml file within it.
		is this referred to as a RAZOR file?
		to add C# code in the html elements, prefix the code inline with @.
